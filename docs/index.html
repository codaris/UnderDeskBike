<h1 id="hacking-a-200-under-desk-exercise-bike" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="1">Hacking a $200 Under Desk Exercise Bike</h1>

<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="3"><img src="images/header.png" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="3" alt=""></p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="5">Due to COVID, I haven’t been getting my usual amount of exercise this year. To help with that, I decided to take a chance and order an under-desk exercise bike to get some extra cardio. The bike I bought is decent: it has good tension, stays in place, operates quietly, and offers Bluetooth connectivity for tracking workouts.</p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="7">If you’re considering getting one of these under-desk bikes, I wouldn’t automatically recommend it. With a standard desk, your knees will likely bump against it. However, my desk is designed for use with a keyboard tray, which I dislike. Instead, I keep my keyboard on top of the desk, raise my chair, and use a footrest. This setup makes my desk a good height for pedaling.</p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="9">Bluetooth connectivity is important to me; being able to view and record speed and distance is a big motivator. Unsurprisingly, the bike comes with a companion phone app. It’s not a great app - it feels unpolished, has mediocre reviews, requires an account, and tries to upsell you on a subscription for classes. I can overlook all that, but sitting at my workstation, I don’t want to pull out my phone and navigate through several steps every time I want to work out. Nor do I want to leave my phone on and propped up on my desk for long periods. Lastly, I didn’t want all my workout data locked away in this app.</p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="11">The solution was obvious - build my own desktop app!</p>
<h2 id="the-project" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="13">The Project</h2>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="15">I was inspired by this article: <a href="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="15">Unbricking a $2,000 Bike With a $10 Raspberry Pi</a>.  I figured my under-desk bike probably worked in a similar way, and if I could connect to it from my desktop, I could write my own application.</p>
<h4 id="objectives" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="17">Objectives</h4>
<ul sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="19">
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="19">Display workout data in real time in a small window on the desktop.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="20">Record the workout data to a SQLite database for analysis, goal setting, and motivation.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="21">Automatically start and stop the app whenever I start pedaling, if possible.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="complications" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="23">Complications</h4>
<ul sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="25">
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="25">My desktop didn't have Bluetooth</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="26">Zero experience working with Bluetooth LE</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="28">I solved the first issue by purchasing a USB Bluetooth dongle from Amazon. The second issue was something I would tackle with this project.</p>
<h2 id="step-1---research" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="30">Step 1 - Research</h2>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">The first step was to search for as much information as possible. This led me to a piece of software called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">nRF Connect</a>.  This Android app provides details about nearby Bluetooth devices, lets you connect to them, displays available profiles, and logs data. Using it, I learned that the bike uses a chip called <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/include/bluetooth/services/nus.html" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">Nordic UART</a>, which essentially provides a serial connection over Bluetooth. This was great news - it suggested the bike was simply streaming bytes.</p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">However, connecting with nRF Connect didn’t immediately provide any data. While I could connect and subscribe to changes, no data was being sent. This required further investigation.</p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">The next step was to run the app and log all Bluetooth traffic to understand what was happening. After some more research, I found <a href="https://medium.com/@charlie.d.anderson/how-to-get-the-bluetooth-host-controller-interface-logs-from-a-modern-android-phone-d23bde00b9fa" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">this article</a>, which explains how to enable Bluetooth logging on an Android phone and download the logs for analysis. I enabled screen recording and Bluetooth logging on my phone, did a couple of workouts, and downloaded the logs.</p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Using Wireshark and comparing the logs with my recorded video, I discovered how the app communicates with the bike. The app sends a command packet, and the bike responds with one or more packets. During a workout, the app repeatedly sends a specific command, and the bike responds with data packets.</p>
<h2 id="step-2---connecting-to-the-bike" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Step 2 - Connecting to the Bike</h2>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">From the logs and Wireshark analysis, I identified six distinct commands sent by the app. My next task was to create a simple console application to connect to the bike, send these commands, and receive responses. This would test if I could replicate the app’s behavior on my desktop.</p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">I chose .NET 5.0 on Windows for this project, as it provides access to the Windows Runtime Bluetooth API. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-enhance" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Integrating this API is straightforward</a>.</p>
<h2 id="step-3---interpreting-the-data" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">Step 3 - Interpreting the Data</h2>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">The first command sent by the app, which I called the <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Connect</code> command, must be sent before any others. After sending this command, subsequent commands must be sent at intervals of no more than one second, or the bike disconnects.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-none" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">Start Command:  f9 d0 00 c9
Response:       f9 e0 00 d9
</code></pre>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">The next command, which I called the <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">Hold</code> command, appears to keep the connection alive. The bike responds with two identical packets each time this command is sent.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-none" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">Hold Command:   f9 d1 05 02 00 00 00 00 d1 
Response #1:    f9 e1 10 07 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 03 37 00 00 2a
Response #2:    f9 e2 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 eb
</code></pre>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">Next were two one-time commands, which I named <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">Info1</code> and <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">Info2</code>. These likely provide model or calibration data.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-none" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">Info1 Command:  f9 d3 0d 01 00 00 2c 00 00 3c 00 a0 00 00 00 00 e2 00 00 00
Response #1:    f9 e3 01 00 dd
Response #2:    f9 e3 0c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e8

Info2 Command:  f9 d4 0f 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 1f 0f 0c 00
Response:       f9 e4 02 00 00 df
</code></pre>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">At this point we can see the pattern emerge.  Every command and response starts with the byte <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">F9</code>.  The next byte contains the command or response type; the high nibble is <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">D</code> for commands and <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">E</code> for responses.  The next byte is the length of the packet not including this header.  The next byte after that appears to be some kind of checksum.</p>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">The most interesting commands come next.  I call these the <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Start Workout</code> and <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Continue Workout</code> commands.  The first command is sent when you start the workout and then app continuously sends the second command to sample data from the bike.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-none" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">Start Cmd:      f9 d5 0d 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 dc 00 00 00

Response #2:    f9 e6 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ef

Continue Cmd:   f9 d5 0d 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 db 00 00 00
Response #1:    f9 e5 10 00 09 00 03 00 07 00 00 00 99 00 00 53 00 00 01 ee
Response #2:    f9 e6 10 00 00 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2f 24

</code></pre>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">At this point I could start assembling and interpreting the data.  The first thing I did was combine all the workout result packets together and lop off the header.  Then I biked for 10 minutes collecting the data.</p>

<ul sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="118">
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="118">Lots of constant zeros and a few constant values that can be ignored.</li>

I ran my console app again during a workout to collect these values into CSV and then threw it into Excel for analysis.  Most of the values became pretty obvious by looking at them.

<ul sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">The current second of workout.  This value goes from 0 to 59 over and over.  If you sample faster than every second this value will stay the same for multiple samples.</li>

<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="126">The workout time in seconds.  This starts at zero and continues increasing for as long as I am pedaling.  When I stop pedaling this value will stay the same.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="127">Speed in tenths of a mile per hour.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">Rotations per minute.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="129">Unknown (one byte).  Seems related to workout speed but if not moving it increases by one every second and periodically resets to a value and then keeps counting.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">A speed value from 0 to 9.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="131">2 other unknown byte values.  Both appears to be an average value related to speed over the whole workout but exactly what it represents I don't know.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">With these observations, I decided I only needed 3 commands:  The <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">Connect</code> command, the <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">Start Workout</code> command, and the <code sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">Continue Workout</code> command.  I also didn't need to understand the commands; I just needed to send those bytes in that order.</p>

<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="137">The final step was to organize my work into a <a href="api/" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="137">consistent API</a> and then create a WPF application for the user interface.  This type of application is perfect for MVVM. I used Entity Framework Core to quickly implement SQLite storage for workout data.</p>

<h4 id="final-app-features" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="141">Final App Features:</h4>
<ul sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="143">
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="143">Displays workout time, current speed, current distance, and current RPM during the workout.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="144">At the end of the workout, the values switch to the averages of the workout.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="145">Automatically detects the Bluetooth activating on the bike (it's turned on by pedaling).  This starts the workout and pops up the window.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">Pauses the workout when pedaling stops.  The workout time will blink while paused.  After one minute of being paused the workout ends automatically.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="147">Start and Stop buttons for manually controlling the workout.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="148">The daily distance is shown for goal setting.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="149">Clicking the X to close the app minimizes it to the system tray.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="150">Includes system tray icon with context menu.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="151">Window can be set to Always on Top (right click the window for context menu).</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Option to have the application automatically start on login.</li>
<li sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="153">Saves the workout information and all the samples from the bike to a SQLite database.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion" sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="155">Conclusion</h2>
<p sourcefile="index.md" sourcestartlinenumber="157">The app works great and is everything that I hoped it could be.  Now it's just a matter of seeing how far I can pedal.</p>
